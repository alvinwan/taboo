  "instructions": "This game requires two pairs of players. On your turn, cards will be revealed to you but not your partner. Each card has one word and five unmentionables, and your goal is to convey that one word to your partner to receive a point. You have 60 seconds to convey as many words as possible. Each round, one person from the opposing team will also see cards as you view them, to ensure that none of the unmentionables are uttered. If that opponent catches an unmentionable, the opposing team receives a point. You may not say any part of the target word or of the listed unmentionables, unless your partner guesses one of those words or parts first."
